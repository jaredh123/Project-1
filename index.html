<h2>About me</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I've grown up in Shoreline, WA and continue to live there. After graduating high school, I attended the University of Washington at the Seattle campus for a few years. My only official job experience was with the food service at the Woodland Park Zoo for a little over a year. I decided to enroll in Epicodus because it seemed like a quality and viable option to form job related skills and a path to finding work.</p>

<h3>My Interests</h3>
<p>Most of my interests relate to art or some other crafting. Typically the mediums used for building are wood, metal, or clay. I also incidentally started collecting instruments despite that I'm not practiced in playing them. In combination of these hobbies, I've built some small instruments.</p>

<h3>My Skills</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chew a banana like it's easy</li>
<li>Counting to 5</li>
<li>Adjusting my shirt from an uncomfortable position</li>
<li>Playing a solo game of tic-tac-toe</li>
</ul>
